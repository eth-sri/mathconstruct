Two different cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Every cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers is called a valley. An uphill path is a sequence of one or more cells such that:\n\n(i) the first cell in the sequence is a valley,\n(ii) each subsequent cell in the sequence is adjacent to the previous cell, and\n(iii) the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.\n\nGiven $n = {n}$ find a Nordic square with ${k}$ uphill paths (one can show that this is the minimum number).\n",

If the child can successfully recolor all markers black, the starting placement of markers is deemed successful. Identify a successful starting arrangement that uses the maximum number of 20 white markers, along with the steps taken to recolor them all black.",

Format the answer as two lists of tuples separated by commas within $\\boxed{...}$. For instance, for a $3\\times 3$ grid, the output may look like $\\boxed{([(1, 1), (1,2)], [(1,1,3,3), (1,2,1,1)])}$."

Identify $8$ different such integers $n$, and for each, provide a token configuration where no $k$ yields a quality greater than $\\frac{n-1}{2}$.",

This operation can only be completed if the outer squares each have at least one chip. It is permissible for the middle square to have no chips. \n\nThe goal is to determine how Nemo can execute this operation 16 times, which is the maximum possible number of moves, before it is impossible to continue.

For instance, dialing the extension 318 might result in a call going to 318, 138, or 381. Similarly, if the extension 044 is dialed, it might be received as either 404 or 044. To address this without replacing the system, the company plans to integrate a computer that can identify incorrect dialed extensions and restore them to their intended form. This requires omitting some possible extensions. Given that the digits 0 through 9 are available, determine the collection of 340 extensions that can be safely allocated by the company under this strategy. It can be demonstrated that such a collection is achievable.",

Instead of replacing the entire system, the company plans to use a computer that detects such errors and corrects them to the intended number. To do this, they have to exclude certain extensions to ensure no confusion arises. Given that only the digits 0-4 can be used, provide the list of 45 extensions that do not cause such errors.",

For instance, dialing 318 might connect to 318, 138, or 381, whereas a call intended for 044 could reach either 404 or 044. Instead of overhauling the system, the company plans to incorporate a computer to identify incorrect extensions and correct them automatically. However, this requires omitting certain possible extensions from use.\nAssuming the company can only utilize digits from 0 to 2, determine the list of 11 extensions that can be safely assigned under this scheme.\nIt is possible to demonstrate that such a list exists.",
